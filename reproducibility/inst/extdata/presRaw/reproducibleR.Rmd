---
## Set the Working directory

Before running any of the code in the practicals or slides we need to set the working directory to the folder we unarchived. 

You may navigate to the unarchived Reproducible_R folder in the Rstudio menu.

**Session -> Set Working Directory -> Choose Directory**

or in the console.

```{r setwd_introtoR,eval=F} 
setwd("/PathToMyDownload/Reproducible_R-master/r_course")
# e.g. setwd("~/Downloads/Reproducible_R-master/r_course")
```

## Reproducible Research

>"Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of programs: Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to humans what we want the computer to do."
 -- Donald E. Knuth, Literate Programming, 1984
 
---
## Reproducible Research in R

  
Sometime in the future, I, or someone else, will need to understand what analysis I did here.  

There is a growing push to ensure all research is open and reproducible. New NIH guidelines are going to require plans for preservation and sharing of data, which includes your code. 

Using RStudio to make reproducible documents is very easy, so why not?

---
## A very quick reproducible document in R

- Find your R script of interest.
- Add comments with # to describe  what you are doing.
- Add the sessionInfo() function to the last line.
- Click the "Compile Notebook function" -> Select HTML document as output format.

```{r,eval=F}
# Generate some random numbers and plot them
myRandNumbers <- rnorm(100,10,2)

plot(myRandNumbers)

sessionInfo()
```

---
```{r, results='asis',include=TRUE,echo=FALSE}
if(params$isSlides == "yes"){
  cat("class: inverse, center, middle

# R Markdown

<html><div style='float:left'></div><hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=720px></html> 

---
"    
  )
}else{
  cat("# R Markdown

---
"    
  )
  
}

```

## The Gold Standard

When we do some analysis the ideal situation is ALL aspects of the analysis in a single document. 

Rmarkdown can help with this.

[Here](scripts/markdownExample.html) is an example of a report generated from Rmd. The Rmd from which this is made is in the scripts directory. 

*scripts/markdownExample.html*
*scripts/markdownExample.Rmd*

---
## R Markdown

R Markdown is built on Markdown. 

Github and Sourceforge make use of Markdown syntax in their Readme files and renders these in their web pages. It is also used by other notebook tools like Jupyter. 

https://github.com/github/markup/blob/master/README.md


## Markdown syntax

Markdown uses simple syntax to control text output.

This allows for the inclusion of font styles, text structures, images and code chunks.

---
## R Markdown Structure

There are 3 main parts

1. Header - YAML format
2. Body - Markdown 
3. Code Chunks -  R, python, shell etc.


---
```{r, results='asis',include=TRUE,echo=FALSE}
if(params$isSlides == "yes"){
  cat("class: inverse, center, middle

# R Markdown Header

<html><div style='float:left'></div><hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=720px></html> 

---
"    
  )
}else{
  cat("# R Markdown Header

---
"    
  )
  
}

```

## R Markdown Header

In R Markdown the options for document processing are stored in YAML format at the top of the document. Most of this is automatically generated when you open a new Rmd. 

````{verbatim}
---
title: "My New Analysis"
author: "Tom Carroll"
date: "19th October 2022"
output: html_document
---
````

---
## Controlling output type

The **output** YAML option specifies the document type to be produced. THere are several options.

````{verbatim}
---
output: html_document
---
````
````{verbatim}
---
output: pdf_document
---
````
````{verbatim}
---
output: ioslides_presentation
---
````

---
## Figure options in YAML

Global default options can also be set in the YAML. For example figure sizes can be set within the YAML metadata.

````{verbatim}
---
output: 
  html_document:
    fig_width: 7
    fig_height: 6
---
````
---
## Adding styles

Styles for HTML can be applied using the **theme** option and syntax highlighting styles control by the **highlight** option.

````{verbatim}
---
output: 
  html_document:
    theme: journal
    highlight: espresso
---
````

For a full list of theme options see -
http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/html_document_format.html

```{r, results='asis',include=TRUE,echo=FALSE}
if(params$isSlides == "yes"){
  cat("class: inverse, center, middle

# R Markdown Body

<html><div style='float:left'></div><hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=720px></html> 

---
"    
  )
}else{
  cat("# R Markdown Body

---
"    
  )
  
}

```

## R Markdown Body

The free form text and annotation is set in Markdown. This written as plain text and has a specific set of formatting rules. For example it ignores new lines. 

To include a new line in markdown, you need to end the previous line with two spaces.

````{verbatim}
This is my first line.  # the comment here shows the line end  
This would be a new line.
This wouldn't be a new line.
````

This is my first line.  
This would be a new line.
This wouldn't be a new line.

---
## Font emphasis

Emphasis can be added to text in markdown documents using either the **_** or __*__

````{verbatim}
Italics = _Italics_ or *Italics*
Bold  =  __Bold__ or **Bold**
````
_Italics_  
__Bold__

---
## Including images

Figures or external images can be used in markdown documents.  
Files may be local or accessible from http URL.

````{verbatim}
![alt text](imgs/Dist.jpg)
![alt text](https://rockefelleruniversity.github.io//r_course/imgs/Dist.jpg)
````

---
## HTML links

HTML links can be included in Markdown documents either by simply including address in text or by using **[]** for the phrase to add link to, followed the link in **()**
```
https://rockefelleruniversity.github.io/
[Github site](https://rockefelleruniversity.github.io/)

---
## Creating headers

Section headers can be added to Markdown documents.

Headers follow the same conventions as used in HTML markup and can implemented at multiple levels of size. Section headers in Markdown are created by using the **#** symbol

```
# Top level section
## Middle level section
### Bottom level section
```

### Rendered Bottom level section

---
## Lists

Lists can be created in Markdown using the __-__ symbol.  
Nested lists be specified with **+** symbol.

````{verbatim}
- First item
- Second item
    + Second item A
    + Second item B
````

My list rendered:  

- First item
- Second item
    + Second item A
    + Second item B

```{r, results='asis',include=TRUE,echo=FALSE}
if(params$isSlides == "yes"){
  cat("class: inverse, center, middle

# R Markdown Code Chunks

<html><div style='float:left'></div><hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=720px></html> 

---
"    
  )
}else{
  cat("# R Markdown Code Chunks

---
"    
  )
  
}

```

## Code chunks

In RMarkdown, text may be highlighted as if code by placing the text between apostrophes in triplicate: '''. The engine used to evaluate the code is in curly brackets, in this case R.

````{verbatim}
```{r}
hist(rnorm(100))
```
````

This is what the code chunk renders to in your report:
```{r}
hist(rnorm(100))
```

---
## Code chunk options

Many other options can be supplied to an individual code chunk

R can produce a lot of output not related to your results. To control whether messages and warnings are reported in the rendered document we can specify the **message** and **warning** arguments. 

Loading libraries in R Markdown is often somewhere you would specify these as FALSE.

````{verbatim}
```{r,warning=F,message=F} 
library(ggplot2)
```
````

---
## Code chunk options

There are many chunk control options
* eval - Run the code?
* echo - Include code in final report?
* tidy - tidy up the code?
* cache - save a cache 
* fig.height/fig.width - size of plot made by code
* fig.path and dev - save plots to specified path in specified format

"    
  )
}else{
  cat("# Other R Markdown tricks

---
"    
  )
  
}

```

---
## Inserting tables

The results of printing data frames or matrices in the console aren't neat.

We can insert tables into R Markdown by using the knitr function **kable()**.

```{r, eval=T} 
temp <- rnorm(3)
temp2 <- rnorm(3)
dfExample <- data.frame(temp,temp2)
kable(dfExample)
```

---

## Evaluating code in the body

Most of your code will be in code chunks. But it may be useful to report the results of R within the block of Markdown. This can be done adding the code to evalulate within **'r  '**

````{verbatim}
Here is some freeform _markdown_ and the first result
from an rnorm call is 'r rnorm(3)[1]', followed by some 
more free form text.
````

Here is some freeform _markdown_ and the first result
from an rnorm call is `r rnorm(3)[1]`, followed by some more free form text.
