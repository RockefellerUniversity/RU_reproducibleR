These exercises follow the material in the GitHub section of [Reproducible R](https://rockefelleruniversity.github.io/RU_reproducibleR//). 

1. Command line Git

- Create a new folder called GitHub_Training, and turn it into a git repository using the git command line.  
- Create a README.md. Write in the name of a TV show.
- Copy the dayOfWeek Rscript from the *data* directory to the GitHub_Training directory.
- Add and commit each the README and the Rscript separately. 
- Create a project on GitHub. Add this as a remote to your local Git for GitHub_Training. 
- Push changes up to the remote.

```{sh, eval=F,echo=toMessage}
mkdir GitHub_Training
cd GitHub_Training
git init
touch README.md
echo 'The Twilight Zone' >> README.md
cp ../data/dayOfWeek.r .
git add README.md
git commit -m"create README"
git commit -m"add days of week script"
git remote add origin https://github.com/BRC-RU/GitHub_Training.git
git push origin master
```

2.  RStudio Git Integration

- Create a version controlled R project. Link this to your GitHub_Training remote. Save this in a different place to the Git repository you created in section 1 with command line Git.
- Update the README.md to include the name of a movie. 
- Create a new Rmarkdown. Within this source the dayOfWeek Rscript. Add session information. and then compile the Rmarkdown to HTML.
- Update the .gitignore so Rmd files are ignored.
- Stage and commit changes through RStudio. *Remember to not commit every change together. Commit changes that make sense together.*
- Push changes up to GitHub. 

3. Workflow and Collaboration
Next we will practice the GitHub workflow. To do this we will use the repository [here](https://github.com/BRC-RU/GitHub_Training_GIFS). This is my collection of GIFS for how this training session makes me feel, and you can add to this. 

- Contribute to the issues. Either create a new one, or add comments to existing issues. 

- Take a fork of the repository. You can create a local copy through RStudio or command line git.

- Find GIF that you like. ([GIPHY](https://giphy.com/) has lots of options). Copy the URL.

- Open up the README.md document. Add a line to insert you GIF to the README.md. An example line is here: \<img src="https://my_gif_url_here.gif" width="300"/>

- Create a pull request to merge your fork back into the main repository.
